In this project, I used built-in recommenders available in Apache Mahout. Being more specific:
a. ItemRecommend.java consits of codes to built a recommender using the item-based approach. Various similarity metrics are defined and included in the package.
b. UserBasedRecommend.java consists of codes for building a recommender engine using the user-based approach. Various similarity metrics and user neighbourhood definitions are included in the package.
c. Evaluator.java consists of codes for building an engine to evaluate the performance of the various recommender algorithms.
